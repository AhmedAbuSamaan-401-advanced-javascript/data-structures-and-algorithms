# Reverse an Array
The Shift method shift an array in place. The value enterd to the array will become in the center , between all values.


## Challenge
1. Input value or elements in array from user. Store it in some variable say value.
2. Run a loop from 0 to array length in incremented style. The loop structure should look like for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++).
3. Inside loop do slice for for the arry


## Approach & Efficiency
I used the for loop array approach cuz in interview they will ask me to do a such thing and i have to use this way cuz ready functions not allowed.

###### i tested the js code on rapl.it and its working well here is the link :-

###### and here JS on repo:-
