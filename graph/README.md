# Graphs
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list

## Approach & Efficiency
BigO:-
Time : O(1)
Space : O(1)

## API
### addNode():-
insert vertex to the graph 

### addEdge():-
insert edge between two vertex

### getNeighbors():-
its gonna check if there is neighbor vertex will return that vertex

### getNodes():-
will entries the graph as vertexs and edges

### size():-
count how many vertexs in the graph
