# Multibracket Validation

## Challenge
Create a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used nodes to do the lab , also created a function that conatins if statments to check values (3,5).
depends on the input , will return a unique output.
