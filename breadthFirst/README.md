# Graphs
Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list

## Approach & Efficiency
BigO:-
Time : O(1)
Space : O(1)

## API
### addNode():-
insert vertex to the graph 

### addEdge():-
insert edge between two vertex

### getNeighbors():-
its gonna check if there is neighbor vertex will return that vertex

### getNodes():-
will entries the graph as vertexs and edges

### size():-
count how many vertexs in the graph
