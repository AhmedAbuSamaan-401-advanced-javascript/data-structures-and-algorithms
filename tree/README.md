# Tree

## Challenge
1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
2. Create a BinaryTree class:-
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
3. Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.
4. Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used nodes to do the lab , Also created three methods :-
1. preOrder()
2. inOrder()
3. postOrder()
and two important functions :-
1. breadthFirstTraversal()
2. findMaximumValue()

Inorder Traversal :-
In a binary tree, inorder traversal the order of traversing the nodes is :
Left node → Root node → Right node.

Preorder Traversal :-
Preorder traversal the order of traversing the nodes is :
Root node → Left node → Right node.

Postorder Traversal :-
Postorder traversal the order of traversing the nodes is :
Left node → Right node → Root node.
