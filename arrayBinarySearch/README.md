# Search in the Array
The search method will search on a value inside the array. The value enterd to the array will be checked if its in the array or not , if its in the array , output should be the index number of the value , if not will return -1.


## Challenge
1. Input value or elements in array from user. Store it in some variable say value.
2. Run a loop from 0 to array length in incremented style. The loop structure should look like for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++).
3. Inside loop do validation for for the arry


## Approach & Efficiency
I used the for loop array approach cuz in interview they will ask me to do a such thing and i have to use this way cuz ready functions not allowed.

###### i tested the js code on rapl.it and its working well here is the link :-

###### and here JS on repo:-
