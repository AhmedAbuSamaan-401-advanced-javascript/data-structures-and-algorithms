# Reverse an Array
The reverse method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last, and the last array element becomes the first


## Challenge
1. Input size and elements in array from user. Store it in some variable say size and arr.
2. Run a loop from size - 1 to 0 in decremented style. The loop structure should look like for(i=size-1; i>=0; i--).
3. Inside loop print current array element i.e. arr[i]


## Approach & Efficiency
I used the for loop array approach cuz in interview they will ask me to do a such thing and i have to use this way cuz ready functions like reverse() not allowed.
i tested the js code on rapl.it and its working well here is the link :-
[array-reverse](https://repl.it/repls/InternationalKnobbyPostgres)
and here JS on repo:-
[array=reverse](./array-reverse.js)
